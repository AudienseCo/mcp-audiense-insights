Prompts:
This server provides a pre-written prompt called "audiense-demo" that helps users analyze Audiense Insights reports. The prompt accepts a "reportName" argument and guides users through analyzing the insights to solve their challenges. For example, if a user provides "Nike Followers" as the report name, the prompt will search for the most recent report that matches the name, if an id is provided it will search by report id instead. Prompts basically serve as interactive templates that help structure the conversation with the LLM in a useful way.

5. Generate a dashboard:
    a. Now that we have all the data and queries, it's time to create a dashboard, use an artifact to do this.
    b. Use a variety of visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to represent the data.
    c. Explain how each element of the dashboard relates to the business problem.
    d. This dashboard will be theoretically included in the final solution message.

6. Present analysis and recommendations:
   a. Compile key insights discovered during the analysis
   b. Create a comprehensive artifact that includes:
      - Audience understanding and segmentation findings
      - Cultural and behavioral insights
      - Content opportunities and creative ideas
      - Influencer partnership recommendations
      - Platform and format suggestions
   c. Present specific, actionable recommendations based on the data

Remember to maintain consistency throughout the scenario and ensure that all elements (audience, segments) are closely related to the original use case and the report.

Start your first message with an engaging introduction like: "Hi there! I see you're interested in analyzing the audience from the report '{reportName}'. Let's discover some amazing insights about them!"

export const SEGMENT_MATCHING_PROMPT = `You are an expert data analyst tasked with comparing audience segments between two brands: <brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1> and <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2>. Your analysis will be based on Audiense reports for both brands' audiences.

### Important Context:
- Audiense segmentation is AI-driven and does not follow a fixed taxonomy.
- Similar audiences may not have identical segment names across reports.
- Multiple segments in one report might correspond to a single segment in another.
- Cluster names are AI-generated and may not always align across reports.

Your task is to provide a **comprehensive audience comparison**, highlighting similarities and unique aspects of each brand's audience. Follow these steps:

---

### **1. Retrieve Data**
Use the **"get-reports"** MCP tool to obtain the Audiense reports for <brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1> and <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2>.

**Before proceeding with the analysis:**  
- Verify with the user if the matched reports are correct.
- If the reports do not align as expected, suggest alternative reports or prompt the user to enter new brand names.
- Once the user confirms, proceed with the analysis.

---

### **2. Analyze Reports**
Examine both reports, identifying **corresponding segments and unique clusters** for each brand.

---

### **3. Detailed Comparison**
Use the **"report-summary"** MCP tool to compare segments beyond name similarities. Focus on:
   - **Demographics:** Bio keywords, country, age, city, language, gender, interests.
   - **Key influencers:** Most-followed influencers and their affinity scores.
   - **Segment names and relationships:** Identify overlap or unique differentiators.

---

### **4. Create Analysis**
Develop a **Markdown artifact** with the following structure:

#### **a. Title**
**"<brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1> vs <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2> Audience Segment Comparison"**

#### **b. Similar Segments Across Both Brands**
- Create a table with columns:  
  **<brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1> Segment | <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2> Segment | Similarity Notes**  
- Include audience size and percentage of the full audience in parentheses after each segment name.  
  *(e.g., "Gaming Enthusiasts ðŸŽ® (12,530 users, 8.5%)")*  
- Retain all emojis in segment names.

#### **c. Unique <brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1> Segments**
- Create a table with columns:  
  **Segment | Size | Uniqueness Notes**  
- Include all emojis in segment names.
- Include audience size and percentage of the full audience in parentheses after each segment name.  
- Explain what makes each segment unique compared to <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2>.
- Be explicit about **which data points** were used for comparison.

#### **d. Unique <brand2>{{brand2}}</brand2> Segments**
- Create a table with columns:  
  **Segment | Size | Uniqueness Notes**  
- Include all emojis in segment names.
- Include audience size and percentage of the full audience in parentheses after each segment name.  
- Explain what makes each segment unique compared to <brand1>{{brand1}}</brand1>.
- Be explicit about **which data points** were used for comparison.

Use responsive container to ensure the visualization works across different screen sizes.
#### **e. Key Insights**
- Provide a **numbered list** of **6-7 major audience insights**, focusing on:
  - How **brand-specific strengths** shape audience composition.
  - Differences in **regional focus, engagement styles, and interests**.
  - **Content affinities and brand loyalty** trends.
  - Significant shifts in **age demographics and cultural preferences**.
  - Influencer engagement trends across both brands.

### **Thinking Block ("<comparison_analysis>" Tags)**
Before finalizing the output, break down your thought process **inside "<comparison_analysis>" tags** to structure the comparison. **This section is for internal analysis only and will not be included in the final output.**  

#### **Steps in "<comparison_analysis>":**
1. **List all segment names and sizes** for both brands.
2. **Identify corresponding segments**, considering name variations and affinity scores.
3. **Identify unique segments** that lack a clear counterpart.
4. **Define key metrics** (e.g., age ranges, engagement, interests).
5. **For each corresponding pair**, compare similarities/differences.
6. **For unique segments**, explain distinguishing features.
7. **Summarize key findings** for the insights section.

---

### **Guidelines for Analysis**
- Ensure segment comparisons are **data-driven** and not based on assumptions.
- If a segment **partially corresponds to multiple segments**, explain the relationship explicitly.
- Maintain **proper markdown formatting** throughout the final output (headers, tables, lists).
- Your final output **must only contain the Markdown artifact** and **must not duplicate the "<comparison_analysis>" section**.
